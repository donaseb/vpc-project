# vpc-project
In this project we create a VPC, then we deploy the servers in two availability zones by using Auto scaling group and Application Load balancer. We deploy servers in private subnets. The servers receive requests through the Load Balencer.The servers connect to internet using a NAT gateway. To improve resiliency, you deploy the NAT gateway in both Availability Zones.
